## RaxAuth

A simple module to authenticate against the Rackspace Cloud Identity (Keystone).

The object returned from this class after implementing this class and authenticating against the API is the Service Catalog and can be fully epxlored [here](http://docs.rackspace.com/auth/api/v2.0/auth-client-devguide/content/Sample_Request_Response-d1e64.html "RAX API Documentation").

Furture updates will include methods to parse the Service Catalog for useful data.

*This module is extremely immature.*
