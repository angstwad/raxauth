## RaxAuth
___
A simple module to authenticate against the Rackspace Cloud Identity (Keystone).

The object returned after implementing this class and authenticating against the API is the Service Catalog as a dictionary.  The docuemntation for the service catalog response can be found [here](http://docs.rackspace.com/auth/api/v2.0/auth-client-devguide/content/Sample_Request_Response-d1e64.html "RAX API Documentation").

Furture updates will include methods to parse the Service Catalog for useful data.

*This module is extremely immature.*
